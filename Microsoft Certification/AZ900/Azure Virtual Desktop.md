Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on the cloud. It works across devices like Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and Linux, with apps that you can use to access remote desktop apps. Most modern browsers can access Azure Virtual Desktop hosted experiences.

Use Azure Virtual Desktop for specific needs like when security is a concern because all data is saved on the server and cannot be left on the device of a user.
