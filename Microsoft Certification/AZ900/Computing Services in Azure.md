Some examples are:
- **[[Azure Virtual Machines]]**: The most common type of compute, you choose your OS, memory, CPU, storage, and those resources are shared with other customers.
- **[[Azure Virtual Desktop]]**: A desktop and app virtualization service that runs on the cloud;
- **[[Azure Container Instances (ACI)]]**: Docker as a Service, run containerized apps on Azure without provisioning server or VMs.
- **[[Azure App Service]]**: For quick deployment and management of web apps on Azure without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Kubernetes as a Service. Easy to deploy, manage and scale containerizes applications.
- **Azure Service Fabric**: Enterprise Containers as a Service, it's a distributed systems platform. Runs in Azure or on-premisses. Easy to package, deploy and manage scalable and reliable microservices.
- **Azure Functions**: Event-driven, serverless compute (functions) that run code without provisioning or managing services.
- **Azure Batch**: Plans, schedules and executes your batch computer workloads by running 100+ jobs in parallel. Use Spot VMs to save money (previously used low-priority VMs to save on compute. Just old ones.)
