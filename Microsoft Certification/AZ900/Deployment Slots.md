Deployment Slots allow you to create different environments of your web-application associated to a different hostname. This is useful when there is need for a staging environment, a QA environment, and so on.

It's a way to quickly clone your production environment for other users.

Environments **can also be swapped**. So let's say you push your staging environment to production by swapping them. If anything goes wrong with staging, you just swap them back.
