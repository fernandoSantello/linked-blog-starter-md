Ability to **==increase the capacity based==** on the increasing demand of traffic, memory and computing power.
There are two different types of Scalability:
- **Vertical Scaling**: Means scaling **UP**. So I add more processing power to what I already have. If my processor has 8 cores, I substitute it for a processor with 16 cores;
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Means scaling **OUT**. So I multiply the processing power I already have by adding more processors. If my processor has 8 cores, I add as much processors with 8 cores as I need. I add things, I do not improve them.
