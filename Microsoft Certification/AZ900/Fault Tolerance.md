Ability for your service to ==**ensure there is no single point of failure**==, **preventing** the chance of failure.

Fail-overs is when you have a plan to shift traffic to a redundant system in case the primary system fails.

A common example is having a copy of your database where all changes are synced. This secondary system is not used until a fail occurs, and when it does, it becomes the primary database.
