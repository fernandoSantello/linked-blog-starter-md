App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a **fully isolated and dedicated environment** for securely running App Service apps at high scale.

This allows you to host:
- Windows web apps;
- Linux web apps;
- Docker containers;
- Mobile apps;
- Functions.

App Service Environments are appropriate for application workloads that require:
- Very high scale;
- Isolation and secure network access;
- High memory utilization.

Customers can create multiple ASEs within a single Azure region or across multiple Azure regions making ASEs ideal for **horizontally scaling [[Stateless Application]] tiers in support of high request per second (RPS) workloads**

ASEs comes with their own pricing tier.
