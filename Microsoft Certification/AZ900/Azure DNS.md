Azure [[DNS]] is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure.

There are two types of DNS:
- **Public DNS**:
	- Internet facing;
	- Allows you to manage domains for internet accessible domains;
	- Pointing your domain to your website;
	- Setting records to prove you own the domain;
	- Records to connect to your domain to your email server.
- **Private DNS**:
	- Internal facing;
	- Allows you to use your own custom domains instead of the Azure provided domains;
	- Many Azure Services use fully qualified domain name to identify services on the network;

**You can't use Azure DNS to buy a domain name**, like route 53 from AWS.
